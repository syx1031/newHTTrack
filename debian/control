Description: Copy websites to your computer (Offline browser)

 Wide website from the Internet to a local directory, building recursively
 all directories, getting html, images, and other files from the server to

 interrupted downloads. HTTrack is fully configurable, and has an

Description: Build HTTP Caches using archived websites copied by HTTrack
 ProxyTrack is a simple proxy server aimed to deliver content archived by
 HTTrack sessions. It can aggregate multiple download caches, for direct
 use (through any browser) or as an upstream cache slave server.
 This proxy can handle HTTP/1.1 proxy connections, and is able to reply to
 ICPv2 requests for an efficient integration within other cache servers,
 such as Squid. It can also handle transparent HTTP requests to allow
 cached live connections inside an offline network.
